# Relative-and-Absolute-Grading-System-in-Python-
Relative grading and absolute grading are two distinct grading systems that cater to different approaches in evaluating student performance.

Relative Grading: This system assesses students' performance in comparison to their peers, often using statistical methods to determine grade cutoffs. In the provided code, there are two types of relative grading systems: HEC Relative Grading and Custom Relative Grading. The HEC Relative Grading system bases its grade cutoffs on the mean and standard deviation of the scores. For example, students who perform better than two standard deviations above the mean are assigned the highest grade, A*, and so on, with lower grades assigned according to their deviation from the mean. This ensures that the top percentage of students are allocated higher grades, regardless of the overall performance. In contrast, Custom Relative Grading allows for more flexibility by letting instructors define the percentage distribution for each grade (e.g., how many students should receive an "A," "B," etc.). This is implemented in the code by enabling the user to adjust sliders for each grade category in the sidebar, ensuring the distribution aligns with specific educational goals or standards. A key feature of both relative grading methods is that they focus on the distribution of scores rather than absolute performance, meaning that a high score may not guarantee a top grade if many others perform equally well or better.

Absolute Grading: In contrast, absolute grading assigns grades based on predefined score cutoffs, without considering the overall performance of the class. This method is illustrated in the code through both HEC Absolute Grading and Custom Absolute Grading systems. The HEC Absolute Grading system assigns fixed grades based on specific numerical thresholds (e.g., a score of 85 or higher guarantees an "A," a score between 80 and 84.99 results in an "A-," etc.). These thresholds are fixed and do not depend on how others perform in the course. The Custom Absolute Grading system also allows for the definition of cutoffs but provides flexibility for instructors to adjust these thresholds according to their preferences or institutional standards. In both cases, the grades are assigned based on how the studentsâ€™ raw scores compare to these cutoffs, and the grade distribution is not influenced by the performance of the other students in the class.

Comparison: The primary difference between relative and absolute grading lies in how grades are assigned. Relative grading depends on the performance of others, making it possible for all students to receive high grades if the class performs exceptionally well. On the other hand, absolute grading sets fixed standards, so students are evaluated based on their own scores in isolation, irrespective of their peers' performance. Both systems have their advantages and limitations. Relative grading helps normalize grade distributions, particularly in cases where exams may be unusually difficult, while absolute grading is often perceived as more fair since it does not depend on the class's overall performance but rather on a consistent set of expectations.

In the provided code, both systems are implemented with flexibility, allowing users to choose between relative or absolute grading, and even customize their grading thresholds, making it adaptable for different grading strategies.
